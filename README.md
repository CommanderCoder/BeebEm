# BeebEm5
This code is here for archival purposes.  It is no longer supported.

Please STAR and FORK [beebem-mac](https://github.com/commandercoder/beebem-mac) which is now the most current version, and that closely mirrors [beebem-windows]([(https://github.com/stardot/beebem-windows]).


## What was it
Port of BeebEm4 by Jon Welch (https://www.g7jjf.com/download.htm) to make it will work on Mac Catalina and beyond.  Source code is also available from Stardot.org on github (https://github.com/stardot/beebem-mac) 

This is now _DEPRECATE_ in favour of **beebem-mac**
